# AR Glass
AR Glass is a Google Glass app used to control the Parrot AR Drone via head gestures.

## Caveats
- Google Glass wifi sensor has a lower range than a typical Android device,
resulting in a very limited range with the Parrot AR Drone wifi when used outside. As such,
for best performance, it's recommended to use this app in an indoor environment.
- Google Glass might become moderately warm while using the app.

## Installation
* Download and install the app on a Google Glass device.
* Check the [wiki](./wiki) for additional setup information, and usage guide.
